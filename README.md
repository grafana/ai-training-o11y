# AI Training Observability

Layout is as follows:

- Project root contains anything necessary to spin up a dev environment to test end-to-end
- `.config/` has config files for the dev environment
- `observability/` is the python exporter
- `ai-training-api/` contains the metadata (and maybe proxy) service and any necessary files for mysql (specifying database configuration, especially)
- `grafana-aitraining-app/` contains the grafana plugin
